Several functions from `htmd` were moved to the related `moleculekit`Â package. This affects `dihedralAngle`:

    htmd.molecule.util.dihedralAngle(...

is now (with the appropriate import)

    import moleculekit.dihedral
    moleculekit.dihedral.dihedralAngle(...
    
    
Listing 13: RMSD-based alignments

    htmd.molecule.util.molRMSD(...
